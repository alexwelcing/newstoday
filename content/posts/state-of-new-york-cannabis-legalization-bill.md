 S. 854 2 

certain provisions of the agriculture and markets law relating to 
industrial hemp 

The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, 
do enact as follows:

 1 Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "marihuana 
2 regulation and taxation act". 
3 § 2. Chapter 7-A of the consolidated laws is enacted, to read as 
4 follows:

 5 CHAPTER 7-A OF THE CONSOLIDATED LAWS 
6 CANNABIS LAW 
7 ARTICLE 1 
8 SHORT TITLE; LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT; 
9 DEFINITIONS

 10 Section 1. Short title.

 11 2. Legislative findings and intent. 
12 3. Definitions. 
13 Section 1. Short title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited 
14 and referred to as the "cannabis law". 
15 § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that 
16 existing marihuana laws have not been beneficial to the welfare of the 
17 general public. Existing laws have been ineffective in reducing or curb18 
ing marihuana use and have instead resulted in devastating collateral 
19 consequences including mass incarceration and other complex generational 
20 trauma, that inhibit an otherwise law-abiding citizen's ability to 
21 access housing, employment opportunities, and other vital services. 
22 Existing laws have also created an illicit market which represents a 
23 threat to public health and reduces the ability of the legislature to 
24 deter the accessing of marihuana by minors. Existing marihuana laws have 
25 disproportionately impacted African-American and Latinx communities. 
26 The intent of this act is to regulate, control, and tax marihuana, 
27 heretofore known as cannabis, generate significant new revenue, make 
28 substantial investments in communities and people most impacted by mari29 
huana criminalization to address the collateral consequences of such 
30 criminalization, prevent access to cannabis by those under the age of 
31 twenty-one years, reduce the illegal drug market and reduce violent 
32 crime, reduce participation of otherwise law-abiding citizens in the 
33 illicit market, end the racially disparate impact of existing cannabis 
34 laws, create new industries and increase employment and strengthen New 
35 York's agriculture sector. 
36 Nothing in this act is intended to limit the authority of any district 
37 government agency or office or employers to enact and enforce policies 
38 pertaining to cannabis in the workplace, to allow driving under the 
39 influence of cannabis, to allow individuals to engage in conduct that 
40 endangers others, to allow smoking cannabis in any location where smok41 
ing tobacco is prohibited, or to require any individual to engage in any 
42 conduct that violates federal law or to exempt anyone from any require43 
ment of federal law or pose any obstacle to the federal enforcement of 
44 federal law. 
45 The legislature further finds and declares that it is in the best 
46 interest of the state to regulate medical cannabis, adult-use cannabis, 
47 cannabinoid hemp and hemp extracts under independent entities, known as 
48 the cannabis control board and the office of cannabis management.

   practitioner may state in the certification that, in the practitioner's 
   professional opinion, the patient is terminally ill and that the certification 
   shall not expire until the patient dies. 
3. In making a certification, the practitioner may consider the form 
   of medical cannabis the patient should consume, including the method of 
   consumption and any particular strain, variety, and quantity or percentage 
   of cannabis or particular active ingredient, and appropriate dosage. 
   The practitioner may state in the certification any recommendation or 
   limitation the practitioner makes, in his or her professional opinion, 
   concerning the appropriate form or forms of medical cannabis and dosage. 
4. Every practitioner shall consult the prescription monitoring 
   program registry prior to making or issuing a certification, for the 
   purpose of reviewing a patient's controlled substance history. For 
   purposes of this section, a practitioner may authorize a designee to 
   consult the prescription monitoring program registry on his or her 
   behalf, provided that such designation is in accordance with section 
   thirty-three hundred forty-three-a of the public health law.

   themselves. 
7. A registry identification card based on a certification shall 
   expire one year after the date the certification is signed by the practitioner, 
   except as provided for in subdivision eight of this section. 
8. (a) If the practitioner states in the certification that, in the 
   practitioner's professional opinion, the patient would benefit from 
   medical cannabis only until a specified earlier date, then the registry 
   identification card shall expire on that date; (b) if the practitioner 
   states in the certification that in the practitioner's professional 
   opinion the patient is terminally ill and that the certification shall 
   not expire until the patient dies, then the registry identification card 
   shall state that the patient is terminally ill and that the registration 
   card shall not expire until the patient dies; (c) if the practitioner 
   re-issues the certification to terminate the certification on an earlier 
   date, then the registry identification card shall expire on that date 
   and shall be promptly destroyed by the certified patient; (d) if the 
   certification so provides, the registry identification card shall state 
   any recommendation or limitation by the practitioner as to the form or 
   forms of medical cannabis or dosage for the certified patient; and (e) 
   the board shall make regulations to implement this subdivision. 
9. (a) A certification may be a special certification if, in addition 
   to the other requirements for a certification, the practitioner certifies 
   in the certification that the patient's condition is progressive 
   and degenerative or that delay in the patient's certified medical use of 
   cannabis poses a risk to the patient's life or health. 
   (b) The office shall create the form to be used for a special certification 
   and shall make that form available to be downloaded from the 
   office's website. 
10. Prior to issuing a certification a practitioner must complete, at

    For the purposes of this article a person's status as a practitioner is 
    deemed to be a "license" for the purposes of section thirty-three 
    hundred ninety of the public health law and shall be subject to the same 
    revocation process. 
    § 31. Lawful medical use. The possession, acquisition, use, delivery, 
    transfer, transportation, or administration of medical cannabis by a 
    certified patient, designated caregiver or the employees of a designated 
    caregiver facility, for certified medical use, shall be lawful under 
    this article provided that: 
11. the cannabis that may be possessed by a certified patient shall not 
    exceed a sixty-day supply of the dosage if determined by the practitioner, 
    consistent with any guidance and regulations issued by the board, 
    provided that during the last seven days of any sixty-day period, the 
    certified patient may also possess up to such amount for the next 
    sixty-day period; 
12. the cannabis that may be possessed by designated caregivers does

   assisting the patient has been designated as such by the designated 
   caregiver facility. 
   § 32. Registry identification cards. 1. Upon approval of the certification, 
   the office shall issue registry identification cards for certified 
   patients and designated caregivers. A registry identification card 
   shall expire as provided in this article or as otherwise provided in 
   this section. The office shall begin issuing registry identification 
   cards as soon as practicable after the certifications required by this 
   chapter are granted. The office may specify a form for a registry application, 
   in which case the office shall provide the form on request, 
   reproductions of the form may be used, and the form shall be available 
   for downloading from the board's or office's website.

   of the certified patient; (ii) a person designated by a parent or legal 
   guardian; (iii) an employee of a designated caregiver facility, including

   approved by the office upon a sufficient showing that no parent or legal 
   guardian is appropriate or available. 
4. No person may be a designated caregiver if the person is under 
   twenty-one years of age unless a sufficient showing is made to the 
   office that the person should be permitted to serve as a designated 
   caregiver. The requirements for such a showing shall be determined by 
   the board. 
5. No person may be a designated caregiver for more than five certified 
   patients at one time; provided, however, that this limitation shall 
   not apply to a designated caregiver facility, or cannabis research 
   license holder as defined by this chapter. 
6. If a certified patient wishes to change or terminate his or her 
   designated caregiver, for whatever reason, the certified patient shall 
   notify the office as soon as practicable. The office shall issue a 
   notification to the designated caregiver that their registration card is 
   invalid and must be promptly destroyed. The newly designated caregiver 
   must comply with all requirements set forth in this section.

9. If the application of a certified patient designates an individual 
   as a designated caregiver who is not authorized to be a designated caregiver, 
   that portion of the application shall be denied by the office but 
   that shall not affect the approval of the balance of the application. 
10. A registry identification card shall: 
    (a) contain the name of the certified patient or the designated caregiver 
    as the case may be; 
    (b) contain the date of issuance and expiration date of the registry

    number; 
    (d) contain a photograph of the individual to whom the registry identification 
    card is being issued, which shall be obtained by the office 
    in a manner specified by the board in regulations; provided, however, 
    that if the office requires certified patients to submit photographs for 

 S. 854 22 

this purpose, there shall be a reasonable accommodation of certified 
patients who are confined to their homes due to their medical conditions 
and may therefore have difficulty procuring photographs; 

(e) be a secure document as determined by the board; 
(f) plainly state any recommendation or limitation by the practitioner 
as to the form or forms of medical cannabis or dosage for the certified

    registry identification card, he or she shall notify the office within 
    ten days of losing the card. The office shall issue a new registry identification 
    card as soon as practicable, which may contain a new registry 
    identification number, to the certified patient or designated caregiver, 
    as the case may be. 
13. The office shall maintain a confidential list of the persons to 
    whom it has issued registry identification cards. Individual identifying 
    information obtained by the office under this article shall be confidential 
    and exempt from disclosure under article six of the public officers 
    law. 
14. The board shall verify to law enforcement personnel in an appropriate 
    case whether a registry identification card is valid. 
15. If a certified patient or designated caregiver willfully violates 
    any provision of this article as determined by the board, his or her 
    certification and registry identification card may be suspended or 
    revoked. This is in addition to any other penalty that may apply. 
16. The board shall make regulations for special certifications, which 
    shall include expedited procedures and which may require the applicant 
    to submit additional documentation establishing the clinical basis for 
    the special certification. If the board has not established and made 
    available a form for a registry application or renewal application, or 
    established and made available a form for a registry application or 
    renewal application, then in the case of a special certification, a 
    registry application or renewal application that otherwise conforms with 
    the requirements of this section shall not require the use of a form. 
    § 33. Registration as a designated caregiver facility. 1. To obtain,

   otherwise suitable to be hired, and hiring the manager or employee would 
   not compromise public safety, the board shall conduct a thorough review 
   of the nature of the crime, conviction, circumstances, and evidence of 
   rehabilitation of the manager or employee, and shall evaluate the suitability

   agency with respect to: 
   (A) each incident or alleged incident involving the theft, loss, or 
   possible diversion of medical cannabis manufactured or distributed by 
   the applicant; and 
   (B) compliance by the applicant with the laws of the state with 
   respect to any substance listed in section thirty-three hundred six of

which is required to be included in the application. 

(d) If the board is not satisfied that the registered organization 
applicant is entitled to a renewal of the registration, the board shall 
within a reasonably practicable time as determined by the executive 
director, serve upon the registered organization or its attorney of 
record in person or by registered or certified mail an order directing 
the registered organization to show cause why its application for 
renewal should not be denied. The order shall specify in detail the 
respects in which the applicant has not satisfied the board that the 
registration should be renewed. 
(e) Within a reasonably practicable time as determined by the board of

   effective control against diversion; 
   (ii) the applicant is unlikely to comply with all state laws applicable 
   to the activities in which it may engage under the registration;

   racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the applicant's employees and 
   owners prior to a license being renewed. In addition, the board shall

   integrated pest management models, and shall restrict whenever possible, 
   the use of pesticides to those that are registered by the department of 
   environmental conservation or that specifically meet the United States

 S. 854 47

   adequate books and records of all transactions involving the business 
   transacted by such distributor, which shall show the amount of 
   cannabis products purchased by such distributor together with the names, 
   license numbers and places of business of the persons from whom the same

   licensed premises, and the current license number. Such distributor 
   shall deliver to the purchaser a true duplicate invoice stating the name 
   and address of the purchaser, the quantity of cannabis products,

   or agent or employee of such licensee shall accept as written evidence 
   of age by any such person for the purchase of any cannabis or cannabis 
   product, any documentation other than: (a) a valid driver's license or 
   non-driver identification card issued by the commissioner of motor vehicles,

   driver identification card issued by a governmental entity, such licensee 
   or agent or employee thereof may perform a transaction scan as a 

 S. 854 48 

precondition to the sale of any cannabis or cannabis product. Nothing in 
this section shall prohibit a licensee or agent or employee from 
performing such a transaction scan on any of the other documents listed 
in this subdivision if such documents include a bar code or magnetic 
strip that may be scanned by a device capable of deciphering any electronically 
readable format. In instances where the information deciphered 
by the transaction scan fails to match the information printed on 
the driver's license or non-driver identification card presented by the 
card holder, or if the transaction scan indicates that the information 
is false or fraudulent, the attempted purchase of the cannabis or cannabis 
product shall be denied. 

3. No cannabis retail licensee shall sell alcoholic beverages, nor

   violation of the provisions of this chapter or in violation of the rules 
   and regulations of the board.

   in any cultivator, processor, distributor or microbusiness operator 
   licensed pursuant to this article, by stock ownership, interlocking 
   directors, mortgage or lien on any personal or real property or by any 
   other means. Any lien, mortgage or other interest or estate, however, 
   now held by such retailer on or in the personal or real property of such 
   manufacturer or distributor, which mortgage, lien, interest or estate 
   was acquired on or before December thirty-first, two thousand nineteen, 
   shall not be included within the provisions of this subdivision; 
   provided, however, the burden of establishing the time of the accrual of 
   the interest comprehended by this subdivision, shall be upon the person 
   who claims to be entitled to the protection and exemption afforded hereby.

    that a cannabis consumer may be abusing cannabis, such an employee shall 

 S. 854 49 

encourage such cannabis consumer to seek help from a substance use 
disorder program or harm reduction services. The board shall develop 
standard operating procedures and written materials to be distributed to 
cannabis retail licensees in consultation with the office of addiction 
services and supports, for adult-use cannabis retail licensee employees 
to utilize when interacting and/or consulting consumers for purposes of 
this subdivision.

    the hours of operation, size and location of the licensed facility, 
    potency and types of products offered and establishing a minimum and 
    maximum margin for retail dispensary markups of cannabis product or

2. The board's social and economic equity plan shall also promote 
   diversity in commerce, ownership and employment, and opportunities for 
   social and economic equity in the adult-use cannabis industry. A goal

   adult-use cannabis license, permit or registration, the program shall 
   provide direct support in the form of counseling services, education, 
   small business coaching and financial planning, and compliance assistance.

   facts required to be set forth in such application, a supplemental

   with the board within ten days after such change. Failure to do so, if 
   willful and deliberate, may be grounds for revocation of the license. 
   § 96. Fees. The board may charge licensees a reasonable license fee. 
   Such fee may be based on the activities permitted by the license, the 
   amount of cannabinoid hemp or hemp extract to be processed or extracted

   previous license period, or any other factors reasonably deemed appropriate 
   by the board.

    delete permitted activities. 
11. A license shall become void by a change in ownership, substantial 
    corporate change or change of location without prior written approval of 
    the board. The board may make regulations allowing for certain types of 
    changes in ownership without the need for prior written approval. 
    § 101. Granting, suspending or revoking licenses. After due notice and 
    an opportunity to be heard, established by rules and regulations, the 
    board may decline to grant a new license, impose conditions or limits 
    with respect to the grant of a license, modify an existing license or 
    decline to renew a license, and may suspend or revoke a license already

    misleading;

    pursuant to regulations under this article. 

§ 103. Packaging and labeling of cannabinoid hemp and hemp extract. 1. 
Cannabinoid hemp processors shall be required to provide appropriate 

 S. 854 57 

label warning to consumers, and restricted from making unapproved label 
claims, as determined by the board, concerning the potential impact on 
or benefit to human health resulting from the use of cannabinoid hemp, 
hemp extract and products derived therefrom for human consumption, which 
labels shall be affixed to those products when sold, pursuant to rules 
and regulations that the board may adopt. 

2. The board may, by rules and regulations, require processors to 
   establish a code, including, but not limited to QR code, for labels and 
   establish methods and procedures for determining, among other things, 
   serving sizes or dosages for cannabinoid hemp, hemp extract and products 
   derived therefrom, active cannabinoid concentration per serving size, 
   number of servings per container, and the growing region, state or country 
   of origin if not from the United States. Such rules and regulations 
   may require an appropriate fact panel that incorporates data regarding 
   serving sizes and potency thereof. 
3. The packaging, sale, or possession of products derived from cannabinoid 
   hemp or hemp extract used for human consumption not labeled or 
   offered in conformity with regulations under this section shall be 
   grounds for the seizure or quarantine of the product, the imposition of 
   a civil penalty against a processor or retailer, and the suspension, 
   revocation or cancellation of a license, in accordance with this article. 
   § 104. Processing of cannabinoid hemp and hemp extract. 1. No processor 
   shall sell or agree to sell or deliver in the state any cannabinoid 
   hemp, hemp extract or product derived therefrom, used for human consumption, 
   except in sealed containers containing quantities in accordance 
   with size standards pursuant to rules adopted by the board. Such 
   containers shall have affixed thereto such labels as may be required by 
   the rules of the board. 
4. Processors shall take such steps necessary to ensure that the 
   cannabinoid hemp or hemp extract used in their processing operation has 
   only been grown with pesticides that are registered by the department of 
   environmental conservation or that specifically meet the United States 
   environmental protection agency registration exemption criteria for 
   minimum risk, used in compliance with rules, regulations, standards and 
   guidelines issued by the department of environmental conservation for 
   pesticides. 
5. All cannabinoid hemp, hemp extract and products derived therefrom 
   used for human consumption shall be extracted and processed in accordance

   products derived therefrom; and (b) prohibit, or expressly allow, 
   certain products or product classes derived from cannabinoid hemp or 
   hemp extract, to be processed. 
   § 105. Laboratory testing. Every cannabinoid hemp processor shall 
   contract with an independent commercial laboratory to test the hemp 
   extract and products produced by the licensed processor. The board shall 
   establish the necessary qualifications or certifications required for 
   such laboratories used by licensees. The board is authorized to issue 
   rules and regulations consistent with this article establishing the 
   testing required, the reporting of testing results and the form for 
   reporting such laboratory testing results. The board has authority to 

 S. 854 58 

1 require licensees to submit any cannabinoid hemp, hemp extract or prod2 
uct derived therefrom, processed or offered for sale within the state, 
3 for testing by the board. This section shall not obligate the board, in 
4 any way, to perform any testing on hemp, cannabinoid hemp, hemp extract 

or product derived therefrom. 
6 § 106. New York hemp product. The board may establish and adopt offi7 
cial grades and standards for cannabinoid hemp, hemp extract and 
8 products derived therefrom, as the board may deem advisable, which are 
9 produced for sale in this state and, from time to time, may amend or 

modify such grades and standards. 
11 § 107. Penalties. Notwithstanding the provision of any law to the 
12 contrary, the failure to comply with a requirement of this article, or a 
13 regulation thereunder, may be punishable by a civil penalty of not more 
14 than one thousand dollars for a first violation; not more than five 

thousand dollars for a second violation within three years; and not more 
16 than ten thousand dollars for a third violation and each subsequent 
17 violation thereafter, within three years.

er of the department of agriculture and markets, may appoint a New York 

state hemp and hemp extract workgroup, composed of growers, researchers, 
21 producers, processors, manufacturers and trade associations, to make 
22 recommendations for the industrial hemp and cannabinoid hemp programs, 
23 state and federal policies and policy initiatives, and opportunities for 
24 the promotion and marketing of cannabinoid hemp and hemp extract as 

consistent with federal and state laws, rules and regulations. 
26 § 109. Prohibitions. 1. Except as authorized by the United States food 
27 and drug administration, the processing of cannabinoid hemp or hemp 
28 extract used for human consumption is prohibited within the state unless 
29 the processor is licensed under this article. 

2. Cannabinoid hemp and hemp extracts used for human consumption and 
   31 grown or processed outside the state shall not be distributed or sold at 
   32 retail within the state, unless they meet all standards established for 
   33 cannabinoid hemp under state law and regulations. 
   34 3. The retail sale of cannabinoid hemp is prohibited in this state 
   unless the retailer is licensed under this article. 
   36 § 110. Special use permits. The board shall have the authority to

   noid hemp, hemp extract and products derived therefrom, licensed under 
   39 this article. The board may set reasonable fees for such permits, to 

establish the periods during which such permits are valid, and to make 
41 rules and regulations to implement this section. 
42 § 111. Severability. If any provision of this article or the applica43 
tion thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such inva44 
lidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this article 

which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, 
46 and to this end the provisions of this article are declared to be sever47 
able.

8. It shall be the responsibility of the registered organization, 
   licensee or permittee, or other entity under the jurisdiction of the 
   board, to exercise adequate supervision over the registered, licensed or

10. No adult-use cannabis or medical cannabis may be imported to, or

 S. 854 61 

§ 126. License to be confined to premises licensed; premises for which 
no license shall be granted; transporting cannabis. 1. A registration, 
license, or permit issued to any person, pursuant to this chapter, for 
any registered, licensed, or permitted premises shall not be transferable 
to any other person, to any other location or premises, or to any 
other building or part of the building containing the licensed premises 
except in the discretion of the office. All privileges granted by any 
registration, license, or permit shall be available only to the person 
therein specified, and only for the premises licensed and no other 
except if authorized by the board. Provided, however, that the 
provisions of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit the amendment 
of a registration or license as provided for in this chapter. A 
violation of this section shall subject the registration, license, or 
permit to revocation for cause. 

2. Where a registration or license for premises has been revoked, the 
   board in its discretion may refuse to issue a registration, license, or 
   permit under this chapter, for a period of up to five years after such 
   revocation, for such premises or for any part of the building containing 
   such premises and connected therewith. 
3. In determining whether to issue such a proscription against granting 
   any registration, license, or permit for such five-year period, in 
   addition to any other factors deemed relevant to the board, the board 
   shall, in the case of a license revoked due to the sale of cannabis to a 
   person under the age of twenty-one not otherwise authorized by this 
   chapter, determine whether the proposed subsequent licensee has obtained 
   such premises through an arm's length transaction, and, if such transaction 
   is not found to be an arm's length transaction, the office shall 
   deny the issuance of such license. 
4. For purposes of this section, "arm's length transaction" shall mean 
   a sale of a fee of all undivided interests in real property, lease, 
   management agreement, or other agreement giving the applicant control 
   over the cannabis at the premises, or any part thereof, in the open 
   market, between an informed and willing buyer and seller where neither 
   is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by 
   any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the sale 
   was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid 
   the effect of the revocation. The following sales shall be presumed not 
   to be arm's length transactions unless adequate documentation is 
   provided demonstrating that the sale, lease, management agreement, or 
   other agreement giving the applicant control over the cannabis at the 
   premises, was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of 
   permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of the revocation: 
   (a) a sale between relatives; 
   (b) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or 
   (c) a sale, lease, management agreement, or other agreement giving the 
   applicant control over the cannabis at the premises, affected by other 
   facts or circumstances that would indicate that the sale, lease, management 
   agreement, or other agreement giving the applicant control over the 
   cannabis at the premises, is entered into for the primary purpose of 
   permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of the revocation. 
5. No registered organization, licensee or permittee shall transport 
   cannabis products or medical cannabis except in vehicles owned and operated 
   by such registered organization, licensee or permittee, or hired 
   and operated by such registered organization, licensee or permittee from 
   a trucking or transportation company permitted and registered with the 
   board. 

 S. 854 62 

6. No common carrier or person operating a transportation facility in 
   this state, other than the United States government, shall knowingly 
   receive for transportation or delivery within the state any cannabis 
   products or medical cannabis unless the shipment is accompanied by copy 
   of a bill of lading, or other document, showing the name and address of 
   the consignor, the name and address of the consignee, the date of the 
   shipment, and the quantity and kind of cannabis products or medical 
   cannabis contained therein. 
   § 127. Protections for the use of cannabis; unlawful discriminations 
   prohibited. 1. No person, registered organization, licensee or permit-
   tee, employees, or their agents shall be subject to arrest, prosecution, 
   or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or privilege, including 
   but not limited to civil liability or disciplinary action by a business 
   or occupational or professional licensing board or office, solely for 
   conduct permitted under this chapter. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
   appellate division of the supreme court of the state of New York, and 
   any disciplinary or character and fitness committees established by law 
   are occupational and professional licensing boards within the meaning of 
   this section. State or local law enforcement agencies shall not cooperate 
   with or provide assistance to the government of the United States or 
   any agency thereof in enforcing the federal controlled substances act 
   solely for actions consistent with this chapter, except as pursuant to a 
   valid court order. 
7. No school or landlord may refuse to enroll or lease to and may not 
   otherwise penalize a person solely for conduct authorized under this 
   chapter, except as exempted: 
   (a) if failing to do so would cause the school or landlord to lose a 
   monetary or licensing related benefit under federal law or regulations; 
   (b) if the institution has adopted a code of conduct prohibiting 
   cannabis use on the basis of religious belief; or 
   (c) if a property is registered with the New York smoke-free housing 
   registry, it is not required to permit the smoking of cannabis products 
   on its premises. 
8. For the purposes of medical care, including organ transplants, a 
   certified patient's authorized use of medical cannabis must be considered 
   the equivalent of the use of any other medication under the direction 
   of a practitioner and does not constitute the use of an illicit 
   substance or otherwise disqualify a registered qualifying patient from 
   medical care. 
9. (a) No employer shall take adverse employment action against an 
   employee for using cannabis, unless (i) such employee's usage is 
   governed by state or local law or rule, or a collective bargaining 
   agreement that: (1) limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis while 
   performing the employee's job duties; (2) limits or prohibits the usage 
   of cannabis as a condition of attaining or maintaining a license, 
   certification, or professional status required for employment; or (3) 
   governs the testing and disciplinary procedures related to the use of 
   cannabis by employees; and (ii) the employee's usage is in violation of 
   such state or local law or rules, or collective bargaining agreement. 
   (b) Employees whose usage of medical cannabis is governed by state or 
   local law or rules, or a collective bargaining agreement that: (i) 
   limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis while performing the employ-
   ee's job duties; (ii) limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis as a 
   condition of attaining or maintaining a license, certification, or 
   professional status required for employment; or (iii) governs the testing 
   and disciplinary procedures related to the use of cannabis by 

 S. 854 63 

employees, shall be afforded the same rights, procedures and protections 
that are available and applicable to injured workers under the workers' 
compensation law, or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, 
when such injured workers are prescribed medications that may prohibit, 
restrict, or require the modification of the performance of their 
duties. 

(c) Employees shall not face adverse employment actions for usage of 
cannabis, as such conduct is permitted under this chapter, prior to the 
beginning or after the conclusion of the employee's work hours, and off 
of the employer's premises and without use of the employer's equipment 
or other property. 
(d) No employer shall take adverse employment action against an applicant 
for employment, or otherwise discriminate against or refuse to 
interview an applicant for employment, for using cannabis as such 
conduct is permitted under this chapter. 

5. Nothing in this section shall interfere with an employer's obligation 
   to provide a safe and healthy work place, free from recognized 
   hazards, as required by state and federal occupation safety and health 
   law or require an employer to commit any act that would cause the 
   employer to be in violation of any other federal law, or that would 
   result in the loss of a federal contract or federal funding. 
6. Nothing in this section shall restrict an employer's ability to 
   prohibit or take adverse employment action for the possession or use of 
   intoxicating substances during work hours, or require an employer to 
   commit any act that would cause the employer to be in violation of 
   federal law, or that would result in the loss of a federal contract or 
   federal funding. For the purposes of this section, an employer may 
   consider an employee's ability to perform the employee's job responsibilities 
   to be impaired when the employee manifests specific articulable 
   symptoms while working that decrease or lessen the employee's performance 
   of the duties or tasks of the employee's job position. 
7. As used in this section, "adverse employment action" means refusing 
   to hire or employ, barring or discharging from employment, requiring a 
   person to retire from employment, or discriminating against in compensation 
   or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. 
8. No person may be denied custody of or visitation or parenting time 
   with a minor, for conduct allowed under section 222.05 of the penal law, 
   unless the child's physical, mental or emotional condition has been 
   impaired, or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as a result of 
   the person's behavior as established by a fair preponderance of the 
   evidence. For the purposes of this section, this determination cannot be 
   based solely on whether, when, and how often a person uses cannabis 
   without separate evidence of harm. 
   § 128. Permits, registrations and licenses. 1. No permit, registration 
   or license shall be transferable or assignable except that notwithstanding 
   any other provision of law, the permit, registration or license 
   of a sole proprietor converting to corporate form, where such proprietor 
   becomes the sole stockholder and only officer and director of such new 
   corporation, may be transferred to the subject corporation if all 
   requirements of this chapter remain the same with respect to such 
   permit, registration or license as transferred and, further, the registered 
   organization or licensee shall transmit to the board, within ten 
   days of the transfer of license allowable under this subdivision, on a 
   form prescribed by the board, notification of the transfer of such 
   license.

    dispensaries unreasonably impracticable as determined by the board in 
    consultation with the state cannabis advisory board.

   such person from holding public office, attaining public employment, or 
   as a forfeiture of any right or privilege. 
5. Cannabis recovered from individuals who are found to be in 
   violation of this chapter may after notice and opportunity for a hearing

   offenses within a five-year period, the office, upon receipt of 
   notification of such second or subsequent conviction, shall, in addition 
   to any other sanction or civil or criminal penalty imposed pursuant to 
   this chapter, impose on such licensee a civil penalty not to exceed ten 
   thousand dollars. For purposes of this subdivision, a qualifying offense

§ 24. The criminal procedure law is amended by adding a new section 
440.46-a to read as follows: 

§ 440.46-a Motion for resentence; persons convicted of certain marihuana 
offenses. 

1. When a person is serving a sentence for a conviction in this state, 
   whether by trial verdict or guilty plea, under former article two 
   hundred twenty-one of the penal law, and such person's conduct as 
   alleged in the accusatory instrument and/or shown by the guilty plea or 
   trial verdict would not have been a crime under article two hundred 
   twenty-two of the penal law, had such article two hundred twenty-two 
   rather than former article two hundred twenty-one of the penal law been 
   in effect at the time of such conduct, then the chief administrative 
   judge of the state of New York shall, in accordance with this section, 
   automatically vacate, dismiss and expunge such conviction in accordance 
   with section 160.50 of this chapter, and the office of court administration 
   shall immediately notify the state division of criminal justice 
   services, state department of corrections and community supervision and 
   the appropriate local correctional facility which shall immediately 
   effectuate the appropriate relief. Such notification to the division of 
   criminal justice services shall also direct that such agency notify all 
   relevant police and law enforcement agencies of their duty to destroy 
   and/or mark records related to such case in accordance with section 
   160.50 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall prevent a person 
   who believes his or her sentence is required by this section to be 
   vacated, dismissed and/or expunged from filing a petition with the court 
   to effectuate all appropriate relief. 
2. (a) When a person is serving or has completed serving a sentence 
   for a conviction in this state, whether by trial verdict or guilty plea, 
   under former article two hundred twenty-one of the penal law, and such 
   person's conduct as alleged in the accusatory instrument and/or shown by 
   the guilty plea or trial verdict, or shown by other information: (i) 
   would not have been a crime under article two hundred twenty-two of the 

 S. 854 87 

penal law, had such article two hundred twenty-two rather than former 
article two hundred twenty-one of the penal law been in effect at the 
time of such conduct; or (ii) under such circumstances such person would 
have been guilty of a lesser or potentially less onerous offense under 
such article two hundred twenty-two than such former article two hundred 
twenty-one of the penal law; then such person may petition the court of 
conviction pursuant to this article for vacatur of such conviction. 

(b) Upon receiving a served and filed motion under paragraph (a) of 
this subdivision, the court shall presume the movant satisfies the 
criteria in such paragraph (a) and shall grant the motion to vacate such 
conviction unless the party opposing the motion proves, by clear and 
convincing evidence, that the movant does not satisfy the criteria. If 
the movant satisfies the criteria, the court shall grant the motion to 
vacate the conviction: (i) if the conviction was by plea of guilty, on 
grounds that such plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent owing 
to ongoing consequences; and (ii) if the conviction was by verdict or 
otherwise, on grounds that such conviction and sentence constitutes 
cruel and unusual punishment under the state constitution owing to such 
ongoing consequences; and may, if the petition meets the criteria in 
subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, after affording 
the parties an opportunity to be heard and present evidence, substitute, 
unless it is not in the interests of justice to do so, a conviction for 
an appropriate lesser offense under article two hundred twenty-two of 
the penal law. 
(c) In the event of any vacatur and/or substitution pursuant to this 
subdivision, the office of court administration shall immediately notify 
the state division of criminal justice services concerning such determination. 
Such notification to the division of criminal justice services 
shall also direct that such agency notify all relevant police and law 
enforcement agencies of their duty to destroy and/or mark records 
related to such case in accordance with section 160.50 of this chapter 
or, where conviction for a crime is substituted pursuant to this subdivision, 
update such agencies' records accordingly. 

3. Under no circumstances may substitution under this section result 
   in the imposition of a term of imprisonment or sentencing term, obligation 
   or condition that is in any way either harsher than the original 
   sentence or harsher than the sentence authorized for any substituted 
   lesser offense. 
4. (a) If the judge who originally sentenced the movant for such 
   offense is not reasonably available, then the presiding judge for such 
   court shall designate another judge authorized to act in the appropriate 
   jurisdiction to determine the petition or application. 
   (b) Unless requested by the movant, no hearing is necessary to grant 
   an application filed under subdivision two of this section. 
   (c) When a felony conviction is vacated pursuant to this section and a 
   lesser offense that is a misdemeanor or violation is substituted for 
   such conviction, such lesser offense shall be considered a misdemeanor 
   or violation, as the case may be, for all purposes. When a misdemeanor 
   conviction is vacated pursuant to this section and a lesser offense that 
   is a violation is substituted for such conviction, such lesser offense 
   shall be considered a violation for all purposes. 
   (d) Nothing in this section is intended to or shall diminish or abrogate 
   any rights or remedies otherwise available to a defendant, petitioner 
   or applicant. Relief under this section is available notwithstanding 
   that the judgment was for a violation of former sections 
   221.05, 221.10, 221.15, 221.20, 221.35 or 221.40 of the penal law in 

 S. 854 88 

effect prior to the effective date of this paragraph and that the underlying 
action or proceeding has already been vacated, dismissed and 
expunged.

or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within 
the purview of this section. 
(f) The provisions of this section shall be available, used and 
applied in parallel fashion by the family court and the criminal courts 
to juvenile delinquency adjudications, adolescent offender adjudications 
and youthful offender adjudications. 
(g) The chief administrator of the courts shall promulgate all necessary 
rules and make available all necessary forms to enable the filing 
of the petitions and applications provided in this section no later than 
sixty days following the effective date of this section. All sentences 
eligible for automatic vacatur, dismissal and expungement pursuant to 
subdivision one of this section shall be identified and the required 
entities notified within one year of the effective date of this section.

procedure law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws of 2014, is amended

§ 37. Section 490 of the tax law, as added by chapter 90 of the laws 
of 2014, is amended to read as follows: 

§ 490. \[Definitions] Excise tax on medical cannabis. 1. (a) [All 
definitions of terms applicable to title five-A of article thirty-three 

 S. 854 94 

of the public health law shall apply to this article.] For purposes of 
this article, the terms "medical cannabis," "registered organization," 
"certified patient," and "designated caregiver" shall have the same 
definitions as in section three of the cannabis law. 

(b) As used in this section, where not otherwise specifically defined 
and unless a different meaning is clearly required "gross receipt" means 
the amount received in or by reason of any sale, conditional or otherwise, 
of medical \[marihuana] cannabis or in or by reason of the furnishing 
of medical \[marihuana] cannabis from the sale of medical \[marihuana] 
cannabis provided by a registered organization to a certified patient or 
designated caregiver. Gross receipt is expressed in money, whether paid 
in cash, credit or property of any kind or nature, and shall be determined 
without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the 
service sold or the cost of materials, labor or services used or other 
costs, interest or discount paid, or any other expenses whatsoever. 
"Amount received" for the purpose of the definition of gross receipt, as 
the term gross receipt is used throughout this article, means the amount 
charged for the provision of medical \[marihuana] cannabis. 

2. There is hereby imposed an excise tax on the gross receipts from 
   the sale of medical \[marihuana] cannabis by a registered organization to 
   a certified patient or designated caregiver, to be paid by the registered 
   organization, at the rate of seven percent. The tax imposed by 
   this article shall be charged against and be paid by the registered 
   organization and shall not be added as a separate charge or line item on 
   any sales slip, invoice, receipt or other statement or memorandum of the 
   price given to the retail customer. 
3. The commissioner may make, adopt and amend rules, regulations, 
   procedures and forms necessary for the proper administration of this 
   article. 
4. Every registered organization that makes sales of medical \[marihuana] 
   cannabis subject to the tax imposed by this article shall, on or 
   before the twentieth date of each month, file with the commissioner a 
   return on forms to be prescribed by the commissioner, showing its 
   receipts from the retail sale of medical \[marihuana] cannabis during the 
   preceding calendar month and the amount of tax due thereon. Such returns 
   shall contain such further information as the commissioner may require. 
   Every registered organization required to file a return under this 
   section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay to the commissioner 
   the total amount of tax due on its retail sales of medical \[marihuana] 
   cannabis for the period covered by such return. If a return is not 
   filed when due, the tax shall be due on the day on which the return is 
   required to be filed. 
5. Whenever the commissioner shall determine that any moneys received 
   under the provisions of this article were paid in error, he may cause 
   the same to be refunded, with interest, in accordance with such rules 
   and regulations as he may prescribe, except that no interest shall be 
   allowed or paid if the amount thereof would be less than one dollar. 
   Such interest shall be at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner 
   pursuant to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one 
   of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per 
   annum, from the date when the tax, penalty or interest to be refunded 
   was paid to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more 
   than thirty days. Provided, however, that for the purposes of this 
   subdivision, any tax paid before the last day prescribed for its payment 
   shall be deemed to have been paid on such last day. Such moneys received 
   under the provisions of this article which the commissioner shall deter

 S. 854 95 

mine were paid in error, may be refunded out of funds in the custody of 
the comptroller to the credit of such taxes provided an application 
therefor is filed with the commissioner within two years from the time 
the erroneous payment was made. 

6. The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply 
   to the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the same 
   force and effect as if the language of such article had been incorporated 
   in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax 
   imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision of such 
   article is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or is 
   not relevant to this article. 
7. All taxes, interest and penalties collected or received by the 
   commissioner under this article shall be deposited and disposed of 
   pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this 
   chapter, provided that an amount equal to one hundred percent collected 
   under this article less any amount determined by the commissioner to be 
   reserved by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements shall be paid 
   by the comptroller to the credit of the medical \[marihuana] cannabis 
   trust fund established by section eighty-nine-h of the state finance 
   law. 
8. A registered organization that dispenses medical \[marihuana] cannabis 
   shall provide to the department information on where the medical 
   \[marihuana] cannabis was dispensed and where the medical \[marihuana] 
   cannabis was manufactured. A registered organization that obtains \[marihuana] 
   cannabis from another registered organization shall obtain from 
   such registered organization information on where the medical \[marihuana] 
   cannabis was manufactured.

state or the commissioner is a party or a claimant or on behalf of any 
party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article, 
when the returns or the reports or the facts shown thereby are directly

provided in subdivision two of this section, in any of which events the 
court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence so much 
of said returns or reports or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent 
to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be 
construed to prohibit the commissioner, in his or her discretion, from 
allowing the inspection or delivery of a certified copy of any return or 
report filed under this article or of any information contained in any 
such return or report by or to a duly authorized officer or employee of 
the \[state department of health] cannabis control board; or by or to the

of particular returns or reports and the items thereof. This section 
shall also not be construed to prohibit the disclosure, for tax administration 
purposes, to the division of the budget and the office of the 
state comptroller, of information aggregated from the returns filed by 
all the registered organizations making sales of, or manufacturing, 
medical \[marihuana] cannabis in a specified county, whether the number 
of such registered organizations is one or more. Provided further that, 
notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the commissioner 
may, in his or her discretion, permit the proper officer of any county 
entitled to receive an allocation, following appropriation by the legislature, 
pursuant to this article and section eighty-nine-h of the state 
finance law, or the authorized representative of such officer, to 
inspect any return filed under this article, or may furnish to such

   cannabis, or the duly authorized representatives of such \[commissioner 
   or of any such] officers, to inspect returns or reports made pursuant to

   or an abstract of the information therein contained, or any portion 
   thereof, or may supply \[such commissioner or] any such officers or such

   organization making returns or reports hereunder. The commissioner 
   may refuse to supply information pursuant to this subdivision \[to the 
   commissioner of internal revenue of the United States or] to the officers 
   of any other state if the statutes \[of the United States, or] of 
   the state represented by such officers, do not grant substantially similar 
   privileges to the commissioner, but such refusal shall not be mandatory. 
   Information shall not be supplied to [the commissioner of internal 

 S. 854 97 

1 revenue of the United States or] the appropriate officers of any other 
2 state which regulates or taxes medical \[ ]marihuana , or the dulycannabis 
3 authorized representatives \[ ]of such commissioner orof any of such 
4 officers, unless such \[commissioner,] officer or other representatives 
shall agree not to divulge or make known in any manner the information 
6 so supplied, but such officers may transmit such information to their 
7 employees or legal representatives when necessary, who in turn shall be 
8 subject to the same restrictions as those hereby imposed upon such 
9 \[commissioner,] officer or other representatives. 

3. (a) Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the

   51 or transfer of adult-use cannabis products by any person to a retail 
   52 dispensary at the rate of eighteen percent of the amount charged by 
   53 such person for adult-use cannabis products, which shall accrue at the 
   54 time of such sale or transfer. Where the retail dispensary is operated 
   by a person licensed under the cannabis law as a registered organiza

 S. 854 98 

tion, such tax shall be paid by the retail dispensary at the rate of 
eighteen percent of the price charged to the retail customer and shall 
accrue at the time of such sale. 

(b) In addition to the taxes imposed by subdivision (a) of this 
section, there is hereby imposed a tax on the sale or transfer of 
adult-use cannabis products by any person to a retail dispensary at the 
rate of one percent of the amount charged by such person for such 
adult-use cannabis products, which shall accrue at the time of such sale 
or transfer. The tax imposed by this subdivision shall be in trust for 
and on account of a city having a population of one million or more, or

the state are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the 
burden of proof that the taxes imposed by subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) 
of this section have been paid shall be upon the person in possession 
thereof where such person holds any license under the cannabis law. 
Every person holding a license under the cannabis law who possesses 
adult-use cannabis products upon which such taxes have not been paid 
shall be liable for the payment of such taxes, and the failure of such 
person to produce to the commissioner or his or her authorized representative 
upon demand an invoice for any adult-use cannabis products in his

taxes imposed by article twenty of this chapter shall not apply to any 
product subject to tax under this article. 
§ 494. Registration and renewal. (a) Every person to whom adult-use 
cannabis products are sold or transferred, and every person licensed as 
a microbusiness, cooperative or registered organization under the cannabis 
law must file with the commissioner a properly completed application

to apply for such certificate of registration, such person must first be 
in possession of a valid license from the office of cannabis management. 
An application for a certificate of registration must be submitted electronically, 
on a form prescribed by the commissioner, and must be accompanied 
by a non-refundable application fee of six hundred dollars. A 
certificate of registration shall not be assignable or transferable and 
shall be destroyed immediately upon such person ceasing to do business 
as specified in such certificate, or in the event that such business 
never commenced. 

 S. 854 99 

(b) The commissioner shall refuse to issue a certificate of registration 
to any applicant and shall revoke the certificate of registration 
of any such person who does not possess a valid license from the office 
of cannabis management. The commissioner may refuse to issue a certificate 
of registration to any applicant where such applicant: (1) has a 
past-due liability as that term is defined in section one hundred seventy-
one-v of this chapter; (2) has had a certificate of registration 
under this article, a license from the office of cannabis management, or 
any license or registration provided for in this chapter revoked within 
one year from the date on which such application was filed; (3) has had 
a certificate of registration under this article, a license from the 
office of cannabis management, or any license or registration provided 
for in this chapter suspended where the suspension is in effect on the 
date the application is filed or ended less than one year from such 
date; (4) has been convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter 
within one year from the date on which such application was filed or the 
certificate was issued as applicable; (5) willfully fails to file a 
report or return required by this article; (6) willfully files, causes 
to be filed, gives or causes to be given a report, return, certificate 
or affidavit required by this article which is false; or (7) willfully 
fails to collect or truthfully account for or pay over any tax imposed 
by this article. 
(c) A certificate of registration shall be valid for the period specified 
thereon, unless earlier suspended or revoked. Upon the expiration 
of the term stated on a certificate of registration, such certificate 
shall be null and void. 
(d) Every holder of a certificate of registration must notify the 
commissioner of changes to any of the information stated on the certificate, 
or of changes to any information contained in the application for 
the certificate of registration. Such notification must be made on or 
before the last day of the month in which a change occurs and must be 
made electronically on a form prescribed by the commissioner. 
(e) Every holder of a certificate of registration under this article 
shall be required to reapply prior to such certificate's expiration, 
during a reapplication period established by the commissioner. Such 
reapplication period shall not occur more frequently than every two 
years. Such reapplication shall be subject to the same requirements and 
conditions as an initial application, including grounds for refusal and 
the payment of the application fee. 
(f) Any person who is required to obtain a certificate of registration 
under subdivision (a) of this section who possesses adult-use cannabis 
products without such certificate shall be subject to a penalty of five 
hundred dollars for each month or part thereof during which adult-use 
cannabis products are possessed without such certificate, not to exceed 
ten thousand dollars in the aggregate. 
§ 495. Returns and payment of tax. (a) 1. Every person to whom 
adult-use cannabis products are sold or transferred, and every person 
licensed as a microbusiness, cooperative or registered organization 
under the cannabis law shall, on or before the twentieth day of the 
month, file with the commissioner a return on forms to be prescribed by 
the commissioner, the total amount of tax due thereon in the preceding 
calendar month, and the total amount of tax due under subdivisions (a), 

(b) and (c) of section four hundred ninety-three of this article on its 
sales to a retail dispensary during the preceding calendar month, along 
with such other information as the commissioner may require. Every 
person required to file a return under this section shall, at the time 

 S. 854 100 

of filing such return, pay to the commissioner the total amount of tax 
due for the period covered by such return. If a return is not filed when 
due, the tax shall be due on the day on which the return is required to 
be filed. 

2. Every person to whom adult-use cannabis products are sold or transferred, 
   and every person licensed as a microbusiness, cooperative or 
   registered organization under the cannabis law shall maintain complete 
   and accurate records in such form as the commissioner may require 
   including, but not limited to, such items as the geographic location of 
   every retail dispensary to which such person sold or transferred adult-
   use cannabis products; and any other record or information required by 
   the commissioner. Such records must be preserved for a period of three 
   years after the filing of the return to which such records relate and 
   must be provided to the commissioner upon request. 
   (b) The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply 
   to the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the same 
   force and effect as if the language of such article had been incorporated 
   in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax 
   imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision of such 
   article is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or is 
   not relevant to this article. 
   (c) 1. All taxes, interest, and penalties collected or received by the 
   commissioner under this article shall be deposited and disposed of 
   pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this 
   chapter, provided that an amount equal to one hundred percent collected 
   under this article less any amount determined by the commissioner to be 
   reserved by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements shall be paid 
   by the comptroller to the credit of the cannabis revenue fund established 
   by section ninety-nine-ii of the state finance law. Of the total 
   revenue collected or received under this article, the comptroller shall 
   retain such amount as the commissioner may determine to be necessary for 
   refunds. The commissioner is authorized and directed to deduct from the 
   registration fees under subdivision (a) of section four hundred ninety-
   four of this article, before deposit into the cannabis revenue fund 
   designated by the comptroller, a reasonable amount necessary to effectuate 
   refunds of appropriations of the department to reimburse the department 
   for the costs incurred to administer, collect, and distribute the 
   taxes imposed by this article. 
3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner shall certify to 
   the comptroller the total amount of tax, penalty and interest received 
   by him or her on account of the tax imposed by subdivisions (b) and (c) 
   of section four hundred ninety-three of this article in trust for and on 
   account of each county and city having a population of one million or 
   more, other than a county wholly within such a city, and the town, 
   village or city in which a retail dispensary is located. On or before 
   the twelfth day of each month, the comptroller, after reserving such 
   fund, shall pay to the appropriate fiscal officer of each such county 
   and city and a designated officer of such town or village or city the 
   taxes, penalties and interest received and certified by the commissioner 
   for the preceding calendar month. 
4. In addition to any other penalty provided in this article or otherwise 
   imposed by law: every person to whom adult-use cannabis products 
   are sold or transferred, and every person licensed as a microbusiness, 
   cooperative or registered organization under the cannabis law who fails 
   to maintain or make available to the commissioner the records required 
   by this section is subject to a penalty not to exceed five hundred 

 S. 854 101 

dollars for the first month or part thereof for which the failure 
occurs. This penalty may not be imposed more than once for failures for 
the same monthly period or part thereof. If the commissioner determines 
that a failure to maintain or make available records in any month was 
entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the commissioner 
must remit the penalty for that month. 

§ 496. Returns to be kept secret. (a) Except in accordance with proper 
judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided by law, it 
shall be unlawful for the commissioner, any officer or employee of the 
department, or any officer or person who, pursuant to this section, is 
permitted to inspect any return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract 
or a portion of any return or report is furnished, or to whom any information 
contained in any return or report is furnished, or any person who 
in any manner may acquire knowledge of the contents of a return or 
report filed pursuant to this article to divulge or make known in any 
manner the content or any other information related to the business of 
the wholesaler contained in any return or report required under this 
article. The officers charged with the custody of such returns or 
reports shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of 
anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, 
except on behalf of the state, the office of cannabis management, or the 
commissioner in an action or proceeding involving the collection of tax 
due under this chapter to which the state or the commissioner is a party 
or a claimant or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding 
under the provisions of this article, when the returns or the reports or 
the facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, 
or in an action or proceeding related to the regulation or taxation 
of adult-use cannabis products on behalf of officers to whom information 
shall have been supplied as provided in this section, in any of which 
events the courts may require the production of, and may admit in 
evidence so much of said returns or reports or of the facts shown thereby 
as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing 
herein shall be construed to prohibit the commissioner, in his or her 
discretion, from allowing the inspection or delivery of a certified copy 
of any return or report filed under this article or of any information 
contained in any such return or report by or to a duly authorized officer 
or employee of the cannabis control board or by or to the attorney 
general or other legal representatives of the state when an action shall 
have been recommended or commenced pursuant to this chapter in which 
such returns or reports or the facts shown thereby are directly 
involved; or the inspection of the returns or reports required under 
this article by the comptroller or duly designated officer or employee 
of the state department of audit and control, for purposes of the audit 
of a refund of any tax paid by the wholesaler under this article; nor to 
prohibit the delivery to such person or a duly authorized representative 
of such person, a certified copy of any return or report filed by such 
person pursuant to this article, nor to prohibit the publication of 
statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular 
returns or reports and the items thereof. This section shall also not be 
construed to prohibit the disclosure, for tax administration purposes, 
to the division of the budget and the office of the state comptroller, 
of information aggregated from the returns filed by all wholesalers 
purchasing and selling such products in the state, whether the number of 
such persons is one or more. Provided further that, notwithstanding the 
provisions of this subdivision, the commissioner may in his or her 
discretion, permit the proper officer of any county entitled to receive 

 S. 854 102 

any distribution of the monies received on account of the tax imposed by 
subdivisions (b) and (c) of section four hundred ninety-three of this 
article, or the authorized representative of such officer, to inspect 
any return filed under this article, or may furnish to such officer or 
the officer's authorized representative an abstract of any such return 
or supply such officer or representative with information concerning an 
item contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of 
tax liability under this article. 

(b) The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit the appropriate 
officers of any other state that regulates or taxes cannabis or 
the duly authorized representatives of such commissioner or of any such 
officers, to inspect returns or reports made pursuant to this article, 
or may furnish to the commissioner or other officer, or duly authorized 
representatives, a copy of any such return or report or an abstract of 
the information therein contained, or any portion thereof, or may supply 
such commissioner or any such officers or such representatives with 
information relating to the business of a wholesaler making returns or 
reports hereunder solely for purposes of tax administration. The commissioner 
may refuse to supply information pursuant to this subdivision to 
the officers of any other state if the statutes of the state represented 
by such officers do not grant substantially similar privileges to the 
commissioner, but such refusal shall not be mandatory. Information shall 
not be supplied to the appropriate officers of any state that regulates 
or taxes cannabis, or the duly authorized representatives of such 
commissioner or of any such officers, unless such commissioner, officer, 
or other representatives shall agree not to divulge or make known in any 
manner the information so supplied, but such officers may transmit such 
information to their employees or legal representatives when necessary, 
who in turn shall be subject to the same restrictions as those hereby 
imposed upon such commissioner, officer or other representatives. 
(c) 1. Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the 
provisions of subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall be dismissed
