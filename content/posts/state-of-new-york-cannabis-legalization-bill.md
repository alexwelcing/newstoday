 S. 854 2 

certain provisions of the agriculture and markets law relating to 
industrial hemp 

The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, 
do enact as follows:

 1 Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "marihuana 
2 regulation and taxation act". 
3 ยง 2. Chapter 7-A of the consolidated laws is enacted, to read as 
4 follows:

 5 CHAPTER 7-A OF THE CONSOLIDATED LAWS 
6 CANNABIS LAW 
7 ARTICLE 1 
8 SHORT TITLE; LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT; 
9 DEFINITIONS

 10 Section 1. Short title.

 11 2. Legislative findings and intent. 
12 3. Definitions. 
13 Section 1. Short title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited 
14 and referred to as the "cannabis law". 
15 ยง 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that 
16 existing marihuana laws have not been beneficial to the welfare of the 
17 general public. Existing laws have been ineffective in reducing or curb18 
ing marihuana use and have instead resulted in devastating collateral 
19 consequences including mass incarceration and other complex generational 
20 trauma, that inhibit an otherwise law-abiding citizen's ability to 
21 access housing, employment opportunities, and other vital services. 
22 Existing laws have also created an illicit market which represents a 
23 threat to public health and reduces the ability of the legislature to 
24 deter the accessing of marihuana by minors. Existing marihuana laws have 
25 disproportionately impacted African-American and Latinx communities. 
26 The intent of this act is to regulate, control, and tax marihuana, 
27 heretofore known as cannabis, generate significant new revenue, make 
28 substantial investments in communities and people most impacted by mari29 
huana criminalization to address the collateral consequences of such 
30 criminalization, prevent access to cannabis by those under the age of 
31 twenty-one years, reduce the illegal drug market and reduce violent 
32 crime, reduce participation of otherwise law-abiding citizens in the 
33 illicit market, end the racially disparate impact of existing cannabis 
34 laws, create new industries and increase employment and strengthen New 
35 York's agriculture sector. 
36 Nothing in this act is intended to limit the authority of any district 
37 government agency or office or employers to enact and enforce policies 
38 pertaining to cannabis in the workplace, to allow driving under the 
39 influence of cannabis, to allow individuals to engage in conduct that 
40 endangers others, to allow smoking cannabis in any location where smok41 
ing tobacco is prohibited, or to require any individual to engage in any 
42 conduct that violates federal law or to exempt anyone from any require43 
ment of federal law or pose any obstacle to the federal enforcement of 
44 federal law. 
45 The legislature further finds and declares that it is in the best 
46 interest of the state to regulate medical cannabis, adult-use cannabis, 
47 cannabinoid hemp and hemp extracts under independent entities, known as 
48 the cannabis control board and the office of cannabis management.

modify such grades and standards.

29 the processor is licensed under this article.

ยง 126. License to be confined to premises licensed; premises for which 
no license shall be granted; transporting cannabis. 1. A registration, 
license, or permit issued to any person, pursuant to this chapter, for 
any registered, licensed, or permitted premises shall not be transferable

except in the discretion of the office. All privileges granted by any 
registration, license, or permit shall be available only to the person 
therein specified, and only for the premises licensed and no other 
except if authorized by the board. Provided, however, that the 
provisions of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit the amendment 
of a registration or license as provided for in this chapter. A 
violation of this section shall subject the registration, license, or 
permit to revocation for cause. 

2. Where a registration or license for premises has been revoked, the 
   board in its discretion may refuse to issue a registration, license, or 
   permit under this chapter, for a period of up to five years after such

   such premises and connected therewith. 
3. In determining whether to issue such a proscription against granting 
   any registration, license, or permit for such five-year period, in 
   addition to any other factors deemed relevant to the board, the board 
   shall, in the case of a license revoked due to the sale of cannabis to a 
   person under the age of twenty-one not otherwise authorized by this 
   chapter, determine whether the proposed subsequent licensee has obtained 
   such premises through an arm's length transaction, and, if such transaction 
   is not found to be an arm's length transaction, the office shall 
   deny the issuance of such license. 
4. For purposes of this section, "arm's length transaction" shall mean 
   a sale of a fee of all undivided interests in real property, lease, 
   management agreement, or other agreement giving the applicant control 
   over the cannabis at the premises, or any part thereof, in the open 
   market, between an informed and willing buyer and seller where neither 
   is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by 
   any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the sale 
   was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid 
   the effect of the revocation. The following sales shall be presumed not 
   to be arm's length transactions unless adequate documentation is 
   provided demonstrating that the sale, lease, management agreement, or 
   other agreement giving the applicant control over the cannabis at the 
   premises, was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of 
   permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of the revocation: 
   (a) a sale between relatives; 
   (b) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or 
   (c) a sale, lease, management agreement, or other agreement giving the 
   applicant control over the cannabis at the premises, affected by other 
   facts or circumstances that would indicate that the sale, lease, management 
   agreement, or other agreement giving the applicant control over the 
   cannabis at the premises, is entered into for the primary purpose of 
   permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of the revocation. 
5. No registered organization, licensee or permittee shall transport 
   cannabis products or medical cannabis except in vehicles owned and operated 
   by such registered organization, licensee or permittee, or hired 
   and operated by such registered organization, licensee or permittee from 
   a trucking or transportation company permitted and registered with the 
   board. 

 S. 854 62 

6. No common carrier or person operating a transportation facility in 
   this state, other than the United States government, shall knowingly 
   receive for transportation or delivery within the state any cannabis 
   products or medical cannabis unless the shipment is accompanied by copy 
   of a bill of lading, or other document, showing the name and address of 
   the consignor, the name and address of the consignee, the date of the 
   shipment, and the quantity and kind of cannabis products or medical 
   cannabis contained therein. 
   ยง 127. Protections for the use of cannabis; unlawful discriminations 
   prohibited. 1. No person, registered organization, licensee or permit-
   tee, employees, or their agents shall be subject to arrest, prosecution, 
   or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or privilege, including 
   but not limited to civil liability or disciplinary action by a business 
   or occupational or professional licensing board or office, solely for 
   conduct permitted under this chapter. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
   appellate division of the supreme court of the state of New York, and 
   any disciplinary or character and fitness committees established by law 
   are occupational and professional licensing boards within the meaning of 
   this section. State or local law enforcement agencies shall not cooperate 
   with or provide assistance to the government of the United States or 
   any agency thereof in enforcing the federal controlled substances act 
   solely for actions consistent with this chapter, except as pursuant to a 
   valid court order. 
7. No school or landlord may refuse to enroll or lease to and may not 
   otherwise penalize a person solely for conduct authorized under this 
   chapter, except as exempted: 
   (a) if failing to do so would cause the school or landlord to lose a 
   monetary or licensing related benefit under federal law or regulations; 
   (b) if the institution has adopted a code of conduct prohibiting 
   cannabis use on the basis of religious belief; or 
   (c) if a property is registered with the New York smoke-free housing 
   registry, it is not required to permit the smoking of cannabis products 
   on its premises. 
8. For the purposes of medical care, including organ transplants, a 
   certified patient's authorized use of medical cannabis must be considered 
   the equivalent of the use of any other medication under the direction 
   of a practitioner and does not constitute the use of an illicit 
   substance or otherwise disqualify a registered qualifying patient from 
   medical care. 
9. (a) No employer shall take adverse employment action against an 
   employee for using cannabis, unless (i) such employee's usage is 
   governed by state or local law or rule, or a collective bargaining 
   agreement that: (1) limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis while 
   performing the employee's job duties; (2) limits or prohibits the usage 
   of cannabis as a condition of attaining or maintaining a license, 
   certification, or professional status required for employment; or (3) 
   governs the testing and disciplinary procedures related to the use of 
   cannabis by employees; and (ii) the employee's usage is in violation of 
   such state or local law or rules, or collective bargaining agreement. 
   (b) Employees whose usage of medical cannabis is governed by state or 
   local law or rules, or a collective bargaining agreement that: (i) 
   limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis while performing the employ-
   ee's job duties; (ii) limits or prohibits the usage of cannabis as a 
   condition of attaining or maintaining a license, certification, or

   whether by trial verdict or guilty plea, under former article two 
   hundred twenty-one of the penal law, and such person's conduct as 
   alleged in the accusatory instrument and/or shown by the guilty plea or 
   trial verdict would not have been a crime under article two hundred 
   twenty-two of the penal law, had such article two hundred twenty-two 
   rather than former article two hundred twenty-one of the penal law been 
   in effect at the time of such conduct, then the chief administrative 
   judge of the state of New York shall, in accordance with this section, 
   automatically vacate, dismiss and expunge such conviction in accordance 
   with section 160.50 of this chapter, and the office of court administration

   services, state department of corrections and community supervision and 
   the appropriate local correctional facility which shall immediately 
   effectuate the appropriate relief. Such notification to the division of 
   criminal justice services shall also direct that such agency notify all 
   relevant police and law enforcement agencies of their duty to destroy 
   and/or mark records related to such case in accordance with section 
   160.50 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall prevent a person 
   who believes his or her sentence is required by this section to be 
   vacated, dismissed and/or expunged from filing a petition with the court 
   to effectuate all appropriate relief. 
2. (a) When a person is serving or has completed serving a sentence 
   for a conviction in this state, whether by trial verdict or guilty plea,

   the guilty plea or trial verdict, or shown by other information: (i) 
   would not have been a crime under article two hundred twenty-two of the 

 S. 854 87 

penal law, had such article two hundred twenty-two rather than former 
article two hundred twenty-one of the penal law been in effect at the 
time of such conduct; or (ii) under such circumstances such person would 
have been guilty of a lesser or potentially less onerous offense under 
such article two hundred twenty-two than such former article two hundred 
twenty-one of the penal law; then such person may petition the court of 
conviction pursuant to this article for vacatur of such conviction. 

(b) Upon receiving a served and filed motion under paragraph (a) of 
this subdivision, the court shall presume the movant satisfies the 
criteria in such paragraph (a) and shall grant the motion to vacate such 
conviction unless the party opposing the motion proves, by clear and 
convincing evidence, that the movant does not satisfy the criteria. If 
the movant satisfies the criteria, the court shall grant the motion to 
vacate the conviction: (i) if the conviction was by plea of guilty, on 
grounds that such plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent owing 
to ongoing consequences; and (ii) if the conviction was by verdict or 
otherwise, on grounds that such conviction and sentence constitutes 
cruel and unusual punishment under the state constitution owing to such 
ongoing consequences; and may, if the petition meets the criteria in 
subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, after affording 
the parties an opportunity to be heard and present evidence, substitute, 
unless it is not in the interests of justice to do so, a conviction for 
an appropriate lesser offense under article two hundred twenty-two of 
the penal law. 
(c) In the event of any vacatur and/or substitution pursuant to this 
subdivision, the office of court administration shall immediately notify 
the state division of criminal justice services concerning such determination. 
Such notification to the division of criminal justice services 
shall also direct that such agency notify all relevant police and law 
enforcement agencies of their duty to destroy and/or mark records 
related to such case in accordance with section 160.50 of this chapter 
or, where conviction for a crime is substituted pursuant to this subdivision, 
update such agencies' records accordingly. 

3. Under no circumstances may substitution under this section result 
   in the imposition of a term of imprisonment or sentencing term, obligation 
   or condition that is in any way either harsher than the original 
   sentence or harsher than the sentence authorized for any substituted 
   lesser offense. 
4. (a) If the judge who originally sentenced the movant for such 
   offense is not reasonably available, then the presiding judge for such 
   court shall designate another judge authorized to act in the appropriate 
   jurisdiction to determine the petition or application. 
   (b) Unless requested by the movant, no hearing is necessary to grant 
   an application filed under subdivision two of this section. 
   (c) When a felony conviction is vacated pursuant to this section and a 
   lesser offense that is a misdemeanor or violation is substituted for 
   such conviction, such lesser offense shall be considered a misdemeanor 
   or violation, as the case may be, for all purposes. When a misdemeanor 
   conviction is vacated pursuant to this section and a lesser offense that 
   is a violation is substituted for such conviction, such lesser offense 
   shall be considered a violation for all purposes. 
   (d) Nothing in this section is intended to or shall diminish or abrogate 
   any rights or remedies otherwise available to a defendant, petitioner 
   or applicant. Relief under this section is available notwithstanding 
   that the judgment was for a violation of former sections 
   221.05, 221.10, 221.15, 221.20, 221.35 or 221.40 of the penal law in 

 S. 854 88

action or proceeding has already been vacated, dismissed and

applied in parallel fashion by the family court and the criminal courts

and youthful offender adjudications.

 S. 854 94 

of the public health law shall apply to this article.] For purposes of 
this article, the terms "medical cannabis," "registered organization," 
"certified patient," and "designated caregiver" shall have the same 
definitions as in section three of the cannabis law. 

(b) As used in this section, where not otherwise specifically defined 
and unless a different meaning is clearly required "gross receipt" means 
the amount received in or by reason of any sale, conditional or otherwise, 
of medical \[marihuana] cannabis or in or by reason of the furnishing 
of medical \[marihuana] cannabis from the sale of medical \[marihuana] 
cannabis provided by a registered organization to a certified patient or 
designated caregiver. Gross receipt is expressed in money, whether paid 
in cash, credit or property of any kind or nature, and shall be determined 
without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the 
service sold or the cost of materials, labor or services used or other 
costs, interest or discount paid, or any other expenses whatsoever. 
"Amount received" for the purpose of the definition of gross receipt, as 
the term gross receipt is used throughout this article, means the amount 
charged for the provision of medical \[marihuana] cannabis. 

2. There is hereby imposed an excise tax on the gross receipts from 
   the sale of medical \[marihuana] cannabis by a registered organization to 
   a certified patient or designated caregiver, to be paid by the registered 
   organization, at the rate of seven percent. The tax imposed by 
   this article shall be charged against and be paid by the registered 
   organization and shall not be added as a separate charge or line item on 
   any sales slip, invoice, receipt or other statement or memorandum of the 
   price given to the retail customer. 
3. The commissioner may make, adopt and amend rules, regulations, 
   procedures and forms necessary for the proper administration of this 
   article.

   cannabis subject to the tax imposed by this article shall, on or 
   before the twentieth date of each month, file with the commissioner a 
   return on forms to be prescribed by the commissioner, showing its 
   receipts from the retail sale of medical \[marihuana] cannabis during the 
   preceding calendar month and the amount of tax due thereon. Such returns 
   shall contain such further information as the commissioner may require. 
   Every registered organization required to file a return under this 
   section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay to the commissioner 
   the total amount of tax due on its retail sales of medical \[marihuana] 
   cannabis for the period covered by such return. If a return is not 
   filed when due, the tax shall be due on the day on which the return is 
   required to be filed. 
5. Whenever the commissioner shall determine that any moneys received 
   under the provisions of this article were paid in error, he may cause 
   the same to be refunded, with interest, in accordance with such rules 
   and regulations as he may prescribe, except that no interest shall be 
   allowed or paid if the amount thereof would be less than one dollar. 
   Such interest shall be at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner 
   pursuant to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one 
   of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per 
   annum, from the date when the tax, penalty or interest to be refunded 
   was paid to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more 
   than thirty days. Provided, however, that for the purposes of this 
   subdivision, any tax paid before the last day prescribed for its payment 
   shall be deemed to have been paid on such last day. Such moneys received 
   under the provisions of this article which the commissioner shall deter

 S. 854 95 

mine were paid in error, may be refunded out of funds in the custody of 
the comptroller to the credit of such taxes provided an application 
therefor is filed with the commissioner within two years from the time 
the erroneous payment was made. 

6. The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply 
   to the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the same 
   force and effect as if the language of such article had been incorporated 
   in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax 
   imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision of such 
   article is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or is 
   not relevant to this article. 
7. All taxes, interest and penalties collected or received by the 
   commissioner under this article shall be deposited and disposed of 
   pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this 
   chapter, provided that an amount equal to one hundred percent collected 
   under this article less any amount determined by the commissioner to be 
   reserved by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements shall be paid 
   by the comptroller to the credit of the medical \[marihuana] cannabis 
   trust fund established by section eighty-nine-h of the state finance 
   law.

pursuant to this article and section eighty-nine-h of the state 
finance law, or the authorized representative of such officer, to 
inspect any return filed under this article, or may furnish to such

   of any other state if the statutes \[of the United States, or] of 
   the state represented by such officers, do not grant substantially similar

   54 time of such sale or transfer. Where the retail dispensary is operated 
   by a person licensed under the cannabis law as a registered organiza

 S. 854 98 

tion, such tax shall be paid by the retail dispensary at the rate of 
eighteen percent of the price charged to the retail customer and shall

thereof where such person holds any license under the cannabis law. 
Every person holding a license under the cannabis law who possesses 
adult-use cannabis products upon which such taxes have not been paid 
shall be liable for the payment of such taxes, and the failure of such 
person to produce to the commissioner or his or her authorized representative 
upon demand an invoice for any adult-use cannabis products in his

 S. 854 99 

(b) The commissioner shall refuse to issue a certificate of registration 
to any applicant and shall revoke the certificate of registration 
of any such person who does not possess a valid license from the office

of registration to any applicant where such applicant: (1) has a 
past-due liability as that term is defined in section one hundred seventy-
one-v of this chapter; (2) has had a certificate of registration 
under this article, a license from the office of cannabis management, or 
any license or registration provided for in this chapter revoked within 
one year from the date on which such application was filed; (3) has had

office of cannabis management, or any license or registration provided 
for in this chapter suspended where the suspension is in effect on the

date; (4) has been convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter 
within one year from the date on which such application was filed or the

of the term stated on a certificate of registration, such certificate 
shall be null and void. 
(d) Every holder of a certificate of registration must notify the 
commissioner of changes to any of the information stated on the certificate, 
or of changes to any information contained in the application for 
the certificate of registration. Such notification must be made on or 
before the last day of the month in which a change occurs and must be 
made electronically on a form prescribed by the commissioner. 
(e) Every holder of a certificate of registration under this article 
shall be required to reapply prior to such certificate's expiration, 
during a reapplication period established by the commissioner. Such 
reapplication period shall not occur more frequently than every two 
years. Such reapplication shall be subject to the same requirements and 
conditions as an initial application, including grounds for refusal and 
the payment of the application fee. 
(f) Any person who is required to obtain a certificate of registration 
under subdivision (a) of this section who possesses adult-use cannabis 
products without such certificate shall be subject to a penalty of five 
hundred dollars for each month or part thereof during which adult-use 
cannabis products are possessed without such certificate, not to exceed 
ten thousand dollars in the aggregate. 
ยง 495. Returns and payment of tax. (a) 1. Every person to whom 
adult-use cannabis products are sold or transferred, and every person 
licensed as a microbusiness, cooperative or registered organization 
under the cannabis law shall, on or before the twentieth day of the 
month, file with the commissioner a return on forms to be prescribed by 
the commissioner, the total amount of tax due thereon in the preceding 
calendar month, and the total amount of tax due under subdivisions (a), 

(b) and (c) of section four hundred ninety-three of this article on its 
sales to a retail dispensary during the preceding calendar month, along

person required to file a return under this section shall, at the time 

 S. 854 100 

of filing such return, pay to the commissioner the total amount of tax 
due for the period covered by such return. If a return is not filed when 
due, the tax shall be due on the day on which the return is required to 
be filed. 

2. Every person to whom adult-use cannabis products are sold or transferred, 
   and every person licensed as a microbusiness, cooperative or 
   registered organization under the cannabis law shall maintain complete 
   and accurate records in such form as the commissioner may require 
   including, but not limited to, such items as the geographic location of 
   every retail dispensary to which such person sold or transferred adult-
   use cannabis products; and any other record or information required by 
   the commissioner. Such records must be preserved for a period of three 
   years after the filing of the return to which such records relate and 
   must be provided to the commissioner upon request. 
   (b) The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply 
   to the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the same 
   force and effect as if the language of such article had been incorporated 
   in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax 
   imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision of such 
   article is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or is 
   not relevant to this article. 
   (c) 1. All taxes, interest, and penalties collected or received by the 
   commissioner under this article shall be deposited and disposed of 
   pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this 
   chapter, provided that an amount equal to one hundred percent collected 
   under this article less any amount determined by the commissioner to be 
   reserved by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements shall be paid 
   by the comptroller to the credit of the cannabis revenue fund established 
   by section ninety-nine-ii of the state finance law. Of the total 
   revenue collected or received under this article, the comptroller shall 
   retain such amount as the commissioner may determine to be necessary for 
   refunds. The commissioner is authorized and directed to deduct from the 
   registration fees under subdivision (a) of section four hundred ninety-
   four of this article, before deposit into the cannabis revenue fund 
   designated by the comptroller, a reasonable amount necessary to effectuate 
   refunds of appropriations of the department to reimburse the department 
   for the costs incurred to administer, collect, and distribute the 
   taxes imposed by this article. 
3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner shall certify to 
   the comptroller the total amount of tax, penalty and interest received 
   by him or her on account of the tax imposed by subdivisions (b) and (c) 
   of section four hundred ninety-three of this article in trust for and on 
   account of each county and city having a population of one million or 
   more, other than a county wholly within such a city, and the town, 
   village or city in which a retail dispensary is located. On or before 
   the twelfth day of each month, the comptroller, after reserving such 
   fund, shall pay to the appropriate fiscal officer of each such county 
   and city and a designated officer of such town or village or city the 
   taxes, penalties and interest received and certified by the commissioner 
   for the preceding calendar month. 
4. In addition to any other penalty provided in this article or otherwise 
   imposed by law: every person to whom adult-use cannabis products 
   are sold or transferred, and every person licensed as a microbusiness, 
   cooperative or registered organization under the cannabis law who fails 
   to maintain or make available to the commissioner the records required 
   by this section is subject to a penalty not to exceed five hundred 

 S. 854 101 

dollars for the first month or part thereof for which the failure 
occurs. This penalty may not be imposed more than once for failures for 
the same monthly period or part thereof. If the commissioner determines 
that a failure to maintain or make available records in any month was 
entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the commissioner 
must remit the penalty for that month. 

ยง 496. Returns to be kept secret. (a) Except in accordance with proper 
judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided by law, it 
shall be unlawful for the commissioner, any officer or employee of the 
department, or any officer or person who, pursuant to this section, is 
permitted to inspect any return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract 
or a portion of any return or report is furnished, or to whom any information 
contained in any return or report is furnished, or any person who 
in any manner may acquire knowledge of the contents of a return or 
report filed pursuant to this article to divulge or make known in any 
manner the content or any other information related to the business of 
the wholesaler contained in any return or report required under this 
article. The officers charged with the custody of such returns or 
reports shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of 
anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, 
except on behalf of the state, the office of cannabis management, or the 
commissioner in an action or proceeding involving the collection of tax 
due under this chapter to which the state or the commissioner is a party 
or a claimant or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding 
under the provisions of this article, when the returns or the reports or 
the facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, 
or in an action or proceeding related to the regulation or taxation 
of adult-use cannabis products on behalf of officers to whom information 
shall have been supplied as provided in this section, in any of which 
events the courts may require the production of, and may admit in 
evidence so much of said returns or reports or of the facts shown thereby 
as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing 
herein shall be construed to prohibit the commissioner, in his or her 
discretion, from allowing the inspection or delivery of a certified copy 
of any return or report filed under this article or of any information 
contained in any such return or report by or to a duly authorized officer 
or employee of the cannabis control board or by or to the attorney 
general or other legal representatives of the state when an action shall 
have been recommended or commenced pursuant to this chapter in which 
such returns or reports or the facts shown thereby are directly 
involved; or the inspection of the returns or reports required under 
this article by the comptroller or duly designated officer or employee 
of the state department of audit and control, for purposes of the audit 
of a refund of any tax paid by the wholesaler under this article; nor to 
prohibit the delivery to such person or a duly authorized representative 
of such person, a certified copy of any return or report filed by such 
person pursuant to this article, nor to prohibit the publication of 
statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular 
returns or reports and the items thereof. This section shall also not be 
construed to prohibit the disclosure, for tax administration purposes, 
to the division of the budget and the office of the state comptroller, 
of information aggregated from the returns filed by all wholesalers 
purchasing and selling such products in the state, whether the number of 
such persons is one or more. Provided further that, notwithstanding the 
provisions of this subdivision, the commissioner may in his or her 
discretion, permit the proper officer of any county entitled to receive 

 S. 854 102 

any distribution of the monies received on account of the tax imposed by 
subdivisions (b) and (c) of section four hundred ninety-three of this 
article, or the authorized representative of such officer, to inspect 
any return filed under this article, or may furnish to such officer or 
the officer's authorized representative an abstract of any such return 
or supply such officer or representative with information concerning an 
item contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of 
tax liability under this article. 

(b) The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit the appropriate 
officers of any other state that regulates or taxes cannabis or 
the duly authorized representatives of such commissioner or of any such 
officers, to inspect returns or reports made pursuant to this article, 
or may furnish to the commissioner or other officer, or duly authorized 
representatives, a copy of any such return or report or an abstract of 
the information therein contained, or any portion thereof, or may supply 
such commissioner or any such officers or such representatives with 
information relating to the business of a wholesaler making returns or 
reports hereunder solely for purposes of tax administration. The commissioner 
may refuse to supply information pursuant to this subdivision to 
the officers of any other state if the statutes of the state represented 
by such officers do not grant substantially similar privileges to the 
commissioner, but such refusal shall not be mandatory. Information shall 
not be supplied to the appropriate officers of any state that regulates 
or taxes cannabis, or the duly authorized representatives of such 
commissioner or of any such officers, unless such commissioner, officer, 
or other representatives shall agree not to divulge or make known in any 
manner the information so supplied, but such officers may transmit such 
information to their employees or legal representatives when necessary, 
who in turn shall be subject to the same restrictions as those hereby 
imposed upon such commissioner, officer or other representatives.
